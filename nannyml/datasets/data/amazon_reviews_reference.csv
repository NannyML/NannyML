The material between the eyes is so thin that I feel like it's held together by 1 or 2 strands. I'm guessing I would have ripped it immediately had I not been careful putting it on. The mouth is terribly small as well and doesn't feel like it's in the proper position. The only good thing about this mask is the material - It's pretty hefty and seems like it would keep me warm, but I can't outlook the issue with the eyes and mouth. It would be so simple to slightly widen the strip between the eyes, and maybe use less fabric on the sides of the mouth.

I purchased this pillow because I am a back sleeper and I wanted a slight incline and cervical support. I opened package let it completely expand. I then laid down for 15 minutes to see if it would work for me. Short answer is NOPE. It claims to be a very supportive memory foam wedge with support for your neck. They do not say that you need to have a specific length of neck for this pillow to be comfortable. I do not have a long neck, however it isn't that short. This pillow did not give the correct alignment for my cervical vertebra to be curved properly. Also the supportive part ends at almost a standard pillow size and then there is a soft floppy pad of light weight and very soft 1"" memory foam. That accounts for half the pillows length. After 5-10 minutes my lower back started to spasm. I will give benefit of the doubt here and add a disclaimer that maybe I happened to get a defective pillow.

I sent my family the link from my order 2 years ago and they purchased it for me. But what arrived is not the same chair at all. I don't think there is a single part on the chair that is the same as the one from 2017. The brackets are thinner. The bolts are silver (as opposed to the brown ones previously that matched). The holes for the bolts don't line up causing the new chair to be crooked and putting pressure on the bolts. The cushions are smaller and more square (cheaper looking).

And the remote for it is so simple, it's just a knob to change the intensity of the vibration. I like that you can take the massager out of the velcro wrap/pouch thing.

I've had corvettes for 6 years now and no product has done to my car what this has. My car is SLIPPERY!!! SMOOTH!!!! LIKE NEVER BEFORE ITS AMAZING! I want to say SLIPPERY again because that's what it does! Do these steps. If your car is stupidly dirty and has been for a long time ***clay bar first*** 1. Start off by wax stripping your car with Meguiars wash+ as a normal car wash expect bucket only method . Do sections at a time (do not let that stuff dry on your car). Water it down and do sections at a time. Please understand that. 2. Use this sealant on your car. Easy on the entire car then buff off after it turns white. Read product directions. You can do it a second time (not necessary) but wait 30 minutes after you buffed first coat. Please wait 6 hours before adding anything else after this. 3. After 6 hours of curing the sealant on paint, use *Car Guys Hybrid Wax Spray*. I bought a gallon, well worth it. Spray your entire car with that while buffing off doing sections at a time. You can do 2 coats for a better result. This stuff will last you months!!! Sealant is once or twice a year. Hybrid spray wax is applied after every car wash. ***Make sure when you wash your car next time to not use wax stripper on it or you'll defeat everything you have done. The wax stripper is a tool used to prep for a new sealant or wax on the car*** Did you read that up there? 4. Also I like to use chemical guys maxi suds grape. Its concentrated and a gallon. Its $18. Buy 2 gallons it will last you 3 years! Use it right, do not exaggerate. *A cap can do 5 gallons of water* Use more If you want. Best car wash shampoo you'll ever use, better then their entire line up as well. 1 galling should last you a year or 2 depending on how you use it and how much. This product is a shampoo that leaves a small amount of wax and a coat of enhanced glossier on your car after every wash. Never wash your car with hard water after you put this stuff on your car or you'll just strip it of your cars surface. *************************************** Do all of this on your car and maintain it that way all the time.

The waterproof compartment at the bottom is excellent, and easily fits my US > 10 size shoes. I'm sure it would make a great use for packing a lunch or picnic items.

This took some getting use to but was able to adjust after a month or two. So you will have an advantage over other controller players, until the controller breaks... Just one year in, the analog sticks are chafing. The residue falls into the controller causing a delay in reaction time. You'll have to blow it out to resolve this issue. My left analog stick also cracked and is constantly falling off (note: I do not throw my controller EVER and do not press hard on the sticks) On top of these issues, the controller wigs out sometimes, turns a deep pink color and the extra buttons don't work at all. There is no fix, you just have to wait for them to start working again. The bottom left button on the back of the controller now only works half the time which is really annoying.

They are very lightweight, the sound quality is on par for what I'd expect, the battery life gets close to 3 hours, and I really like the idea of carrying case, although it would be even better if the top of it stayed attached when you open them. The hardest part for me was understanding how to get both of them to play music simultaneously. Basically, you need to let one of these earphones (doesn't matter which one) pair to the other BEFORE pairing either with device. If you pair with your device first, both of them will show up and you end up having an either/or situation instead of both. So once they're paired with each other, only pair ONE of your earbuds to the phone and VOILA, you have music in both ears! I'll add that one other nice feature is having a separate charging cord that goes straight into the earbuds. With certain competition, the earbuds need their charging case or they can't charge, so kudos on the design here.",Nice set of bluetooth headlines plus a hint on easy pairing of both earbuds,en,wireless,2,0.007883187383413315,0.06902654469013214,0.9230902791023254,2

Unlike some other earbuds I’ve tried, these don’t skip at all. I’ve had no issues with the battery life... I’ve never had them run out while I’m using them. Sound quality... not great. The bass response is poor. It’s slightly better if you can keep the buds firmly inserted in your ear canal, but they seem to work their way out of the ear. They don’t fall off, but they back out. I think this is partially due to the small rubber tab that helps retain them to the outer ear. It’s angled slightly inward (toward the head), and this may put a tiny bit of pressure that gradually pulls the buds out as that rubber tab straightens itself.","Solid Bluetooth Connection to Apple Watch, mediocre sound.",en,wireless,2,0.01839291676878929,0.12878495454788208,0.8528220653533936,2
