I used to shop at Victoria Secrets but when their management changed so did their quality and I don't want to spend good money on sub par underwear. So then I tried Target and some of the underwear was good but other pairs feel apart immediately. I was apprehensive about buying underwear in bulk on line but I thought I'd give it a try. I'm 5'8"", 125 pounds and I am and have been a small always. That's my size. These guys ran a lil small for my taste. Now not all of them, but certain colors are made of different fabrics so some fit while others do not. It's weird. If I had bought them in person I probably could have seen the size discrepancy and picked/bought accordingly but you can't do that online. However, they are much cheaper than any where else so maybe that's the trade off. Either way, I'm not super thrilled and will not be buying these guys again.",Alright,en,apparel,1,0.5939943790435791,0.37610140442848206,0.029904181137681007,0

Damp leaves or stems will quickly plug up the chute because the blades are sturdy, not razor sharp. As long as plants are dried out, they whiz through and fall neatly into the collection bin. It is easy to load, especially if stems are stiff. I have used it on garden debris, not on twigs or small branches, but it should work equally well on them. One thing I particularly like is the ease of setup. I can chip any size bunch of plants and not wait until I have accumulated a huge pile. It is easy to wheel around, easy to disassemble for cleaning, quick to put back together because no tools are required for the job.

Seriously, for the size they made the shorts underneath, which fit perfect on a 5’8’’ size 18, the skirt is like a super tight pencil skirt, the skirt is more a size 14-16. It might work better if I lose another 10 lbs, but then the shorts might be too baggy. And the inside front has this white secondary panel. I guess it’s for not showing anything on the front? But it’s stupid and super itchy and makes the suit fit all thick and bunchy on the front, and it’s waist band to knees, left outer seam to right outer seam. The back is smooth and silky and comfortable. Not gusseted, so it could crawl up if you get it fit too tight. I’m cutting out the weird white liner to see if that helps anything, and maybe the skirt wont slide up when it’s wet, or I may tack it to the side seam on the shirts.

I'm giving it 4 stars because cleaning it isn't so simple. The pot that sits within the product is great. It's non-stick and easy to clean. My issue is with the lid that closes down to seal the rice/food. I've looked up how to remove and clean these components on YouTube and other sites without helpful results. Reading their instruction manual offers the most minimal assistance and is rather insulting. What I've had to do is wipe it clean with a rag on the counter with soap and then wipe the soap off with a clean rag over and over until it's clean. I'd prefer a removable top that can be washed in the dishwasher and was a little dumbfounded when I realized it didn't work that way considering the price compared to cheaper $20 units I've used from places like Target.

Clearly I really liked the Stylos considering the fact that every time a new one came out, I purchased it. Never because one had issues or broke, just because I wanted to stay upgraded and ""in the loop"" and I did. Out of all of those phone's, not once did I ever had any problems with the phone's themselves. When I made this purchase for the Stylo 3 through Virgin Mobile, I just knew everything would go smoothly once I got the phone and set it up but I was very wrong in assuming that. This phone had so many issues that it honestly shocked me how the previous Stylos were so wonderful. I was never even able to sucessfully have this phone transferred to my Virgin Mobile account. I messed around for a little less than a week with this phone. I searched for information on the internet and made various calls desperately trying to give the Stylo 3 the benefit of the doubt hoping it was just me doing something wrong but sadly I wasted a lot of time doing so because it was 100% the phone having all the problems I didn't want to admit. I hate the fact that I have to give a Stylo such a horrible rating and review but I was extremly disappointed with this phone. Hopefully LG ups their game and can improve the future Stylos if there are any but this was a huge BUST.
