"""NannyML drift calculation module.

This module currently contains the following implementations of drift calculation:

- Statistical drift calculation: Calculating drift using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for continuous features
  and Chi-squared test for categorical features.
- Reconstruction error drift calculation: Detect drift by performing dimensionality reduction on the model
  inputs and then applying the inverse transofrmation on the latent (reduced) space.
