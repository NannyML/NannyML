Data Drift Detection
====================

What is data drift and why is it important?
===========================================

Suppose we have a machine learning model that uses some multidimensional input data
:math:`\mathbf{X}` and makes predictions :math:`y`.

Our model has likely been trained on some data distribution :math:`P(\mathbf{X})`.
We have data drift when our production data comes from a different distribution
:math:`P(\mathbf{X'}) \neq P(\mathbf{X})`.

A machine learning model operating on an input distribution different than
the one it has been trained on will probably underperform. It is therefore crucial to detect
data drift, in a timely manner, when we have a model in production. By further investigating the
characteristics of the observed drift, we will be able to estimate the impact
of the drift on the model's performance.

Let us note here that data drift is not the only change that can happen when we have a
machine learning model in production. Another change we can have is concept drift.
Here, the distribution of our input data stays the same, but the relationship between our outcome
changes. In this case we have: :math:`P(y'|\mathbf{X'}) \neq P(y|\mathbf{X})` while
:math:`P(\mathbf{X'}) = P(\mathbf{X})`.

There is also a special case of data drift called label shift. In this case, the outcome
distributions between our training and production data are different, meaning
:math:`P(y') \neq P(y)`. However, the relationship between our population characteristics and
a specific outcome does not change, namely :math:`P(\mathbf{X'}|y') = P(\mathbf{X}|y)`.


Data Partitions
================

As can be seen from our data drift discussion earlier, before we can start talking about data drift,
we need to have two different datasets to compare. NannyML uses the reference partition and the
analysis partition for this purpose.

Reference Partition
-------------------

The reference partition's purpose is to serve as a dataset suitable for our machine learning model.
We also assume that the performance results of our model are available for this dataset and that they
are acceptable.

The reference dataset can be the test set we used when evaluating our model before
we deploy it to production. Alternatively, it can be a reference (or benchmark) period when our
model is in production and its performance results where satisfactory.

Analysis Partition
------------------

The analysis partition's purpose is the dataset where we want to examine the performance of our
model. This will usually consist of the latest production data up to a desired point in the past,
which will be after the point where our reference partition ends. The analysis partition is not
required to have ground truth and associated performance results available.

As part of our data drift analysis, we will compare periods of the analysis partition, which we
call chunks internally in NannyML, with the reference data. NannyML will flag any meaningful
differences as data drift.


Data Drift in practice
======================

NannyML uses two approaches to detect and investigate data drift. A Univariate approach and a
Multivariate approach.

Data Preparation
----------------

We use the dataset we imported from :ref:`the import data guide<import-data>`.
Hence we assume that we have the following objects set up:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> type(md)
    <class 'nannyml.metadata.ModelMetadata'>
    >>> type(reference)
    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
    >>> type(analysis)
    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>


.. _data-drift-univariate:

Univariate Drift Detection
--------------------------

Our he Univariate approach for data drift looks at each variable individually and conducts statistical
tests comparing the chunks created from the datasets with the reference dataset.
For continuous features we use the KS Test and for categorical features we use the 2 sample
Chi squared test. Both tests provide a statistic where they measure the observed drift
and a p-value that shows how likely we are to get the observed sample if there was no drift.

The :meth:`nannyml.drift.statistical_drift_calculator` module implements this functionality.
An example of us using it can be seen below:

.. code-block:: python

    # Let's initialize the object that will perform the Univariate Drift calculations
    >>> univariate_calculator = nml.StatisticalDriftCalculator(model_metadata=md)
    # We want to compare drift versus the full reference dataset.
    >>> univariate_calculator.fit(reference_data=reference)
    # let's see drift statistics for all available data (and let's use a chunk size of 5000 data points)
    >>> data = pd.concat([reference, analysis])
    >>> univariate_results = univariate_calculator.calculate(data=data, chunk_size=5000)
    >>> univariate_results

We see that for each feature we have 3 columns with results. The first column contains the corresponding test
statistic. The second column contains the corresponding p-value and the third value contains whether we have
a drift alert for that feature and the relevant chunk.

Multivariate Drift Detection
----------------------------

The univariate approach to data drift detection is very useful. But unfortunately it does not
tell us the full story. Data living in multidimensional spaces can have complex structures
whose change may not be visible by just viewing the distributions of each features. We go
into more detail on this issue at :ref:`Data Reconstruction with PCA Deep Dive<data-reconstruction-pca>`.

For drift detection purposes the key thing we need to know is that a change in reconstruction error
values reflects a change in the structure we have learnt for our data. We therefore monitor
reconstruction error over time for our machine learning models and raise an alert if the
values get outside the range of what we are accustomed to.

The :meth:`nannyml.drift.DataReconstructionDriftCalculator` module implements this functionality.
An example of us using it can be seen below:
