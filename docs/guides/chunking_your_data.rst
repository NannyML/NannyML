Chunking data
====

All the results generated by NannyML are calculated and presented on the level of data chunk. This guide will walk you
through the ways analyzed data can be split into chunks. If you feel like you don't know what *chunk* is, have a look
at :term:`Data Chunk`.

Time-based chunking
====
Time-based chunking is simply creating chunks based on time intervals. One chunk can contain all the observations
from single hour, day, week, month etc.

Different partitions within one chunk
====
If you want to get performance estimation or data drift results for a dataset that contains two
partitions - *reference* and *analysis* (see :term:`Partition`), most likely
there will be a chunk that contains both of them. We call it transition chunk. All the chunks before belong to
*reference* period
and all after, based on *analysis* period, are *actual* results. This is especially important for Performance Estimation
(# TODO naming?), where *reference* period should be treated like you treat your train set when modelling whereas
*analysis* is like test - the quality of estimation on the *reference* will most likely be much better than on
*analysis*.

It may happen that there is no transition chunk, in that case (# TODO)
