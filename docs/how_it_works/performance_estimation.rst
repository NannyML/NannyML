Confidence-based Performance Estimation
=======================================

Binary classification
=====================

A binary classification model typically returns two outputs for each prediction - a class (binary) and a class
probability prediction (sometimes referred to as score). The score provides information about the confidence of the
prediction. A rule of thumb is that, the closer a score is to its lower or upper limit (usually 0 and 1), the higher
the probability that a classifierâ€™s prediction is correct. When this score is an actual probability, it can be
directly used to calculate the probability of making an error. For instance, imagine a high-performing model which,
for a large set of observations, returns a prediction of 1 (positive class) with probability of 0.9. It means that
for approximately 90% of these observations, the model is correct while for the other 10% the model is wrong.
Assuming properly calibrated probabilities, confusion matrix elements can be estimated and then used to calculate any
performance metric. Algorithms for estimating one of the simplest metrics (accuracy) and of the most complex (AUROC) are
described below. Common notation used in the sections below is following:

    :math:`n` - number of analyzed observations/predictions,

    :math:`\hat{p} = Pr(y=1)` - monitored model probability estimate,

    :math:`y` - target label, :math:`y\in{\{0,1\}}`,

    :math:`\hat{y}` - predicted label, :math:`\hat{y}\in{\{0,1\}}`.

Estimating Accuracy
-------------------

Accuracy is simply the ratio of correct predictions to all predictions.
It can be expressed as:

.. math::
    Accuracy = \frac{TP+TN}{TP+FP+TN+FN} = \frac{TP+TN}{n}

Since the number of observations (:math:`n`) is known, the task comes down to estimating True Positives (TP) and
True Negatives (TN). The algorithm runs as follows:


    1. Get :math:`j`-*th* prediction from :math:`\mathbf{\hat{p}}`, denote :math:`\hat{p}_j`, and predicted label from
       :math:`\mathbf{\hat{y}}`, denote :math:`\hat{y}_j`.

    2. Calculate the estimated probability that the prediction is false:

    .. math::
        P(\hat{y} \neq y)_{j} = |\hat{y}_{j} -  \hat{p}_{j}|

    3. Calculate the estimated probability that the prediction is correct:

    .. math::
        P(\hat{y} = y)_{j}=1-P(\hat{y} \neq y)_{j}

    4. Calculate estimated confusion matrix element required for the metric:

    .. math::
        TP_{j}=\begin{cases}P(\hat{y} = y)_{j},\qquad  \ \hat{y}_{j}=1  \\  0, \qquad \qquad \qquad
        \hat{y}_{j}=0 \end{cases}

    .. math::
        TN_{j}=\begin{cases} 0,\qquad \qquad \qquad \hat{y}_{j}=1 \\ P(\hat{y} = y)_{j},\qquad \
        \hat{y}_{j}=0\end{cases}

    5. Get estimated confusion matrix elements for the whole set of predictions, e.g. for True Positives:

    .. math::
        {TP} = \sum_{j}^{n} {TP}_{j}

    6. Estimate accuracy:

    .. math::
        Accuracy = \frac{TP+TN}{n}


Estimating ROC AUC
------------------

ROC AUC is much more complex than accuracy. To calculate it one needs values of confusion matrix elements (True
Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, False Negatives)
for a set of all thresholds :math:`t`. This set is obtained by selecting subset of :math:`m`
unique values from the set of probability predictions
:math:`\mathbf{\hat{p}}` and sorting them increasingly.
Therefore :math:`\mathbf{t}=\{\hat{p_1}, \hat{p_2}, ..., \hat{p_m}\}` and
:math:`\hat{p_1} < \hat{p_2} < ... < \hat{p_m}` (notice that in some cases :math:`m=n`).

The algorithm runs as follows:

    1. Get :math:`i`-*th* threshold from :math:`\mathbf{t}`,  denote :math:`t_i`.
    2. Get :math:`j`-*th* prediction from :math:`\mathbf{\hat{p}}`, denote :math:`\hat{p}_j`.
    3. Get binary prediction by thresholding probability estimate:

    .. math::
        \hat{y}_{i,j}=\begin{cases}1,\qquad  \hat{p}_j \geq t_i \\ 0,\qquad  \hat{p}_j < t_i \end{cases}

    4. Calculate the estimated probability that the prediction is false:

    .. math::
        P(\hat{y} \neq y)_{i,j} = |\hat{y}_{i,j} -  \hat{p}_{j}|

    5. Calculate the estimated probability that the prediction is correct:

    .. math::
        P(\hat{y} = y)_{i,j}=1-P(\hat{y} \neq y)_{i,j}

    6. Calculate the confusion matrix elements probability:

    .. math::
        TP_{i,j}=\begin{cases}P(\hat{y} = y)_{i,j},\qquad  \hat{y}_{i,j}=1  \\  0,\qquad \qquad \qquad \thinspace  \hat{y}_{i,j}=0 \end{cases}

    .. math::
        FP_{i,j}=\begin{cases}P(\hat{y} \neq y)_{i,j},\qquad  \hat{y}_{i,j}=1  \\  0,\qquad \qquad \qquad \thinspace  \hat{y}_{i,j}=0
        \end{cases}

    .. math::
        TN_{i,j}=\begin{cases} 0,\qquad \qquad \qquad \thinspace  \hat{y}_{i,j}=1 \\ P(\hat{y} = y)_{i,j},\qquad \hat{y}_{i,j}=0\end{cases}

    .. math::
        FN_{i,j}=\begin{cases} 0,\qquad \qquad \qquad \thinspace  \hat{y}_{i,j}=1 \\ P(\hat{y} \neq y)_{i,j},\qquad \hat{y}_{i,j}=0\end{cases}

    7. Calculate steps 2-6 for all predictions in :math:`\hat{\mathbf{p}}`
       (i.e. for all :math:`j` from 1 to :math:`n`) so
       that confusion matrix elements are calculated for each prediction.

    8. Get estimated confusion matrix elements for the whole set of predictions, e.g. for True Positives:

    .. math::
        {TP}_i = \sum_{j}^{n} {TP}_{i,j}

    9. Calculate estimated true positive rate and false positive rate:

    .. math::
        {TPR}_i = \frac{{TP}_i}{{TP}_i + {FN}_i}
    .. math::
        {FPR}_i = \frac{{FP}_i}{{FP}_i + {TN}_i}

    10. Repeat steps 1-9 to get :math:`TPR` and :math:`FPR` for all thresholds :math:`\mathbf{t}` (i.e. for
        :math:`i` from 1 to :math:`m`). As a result, get vectors of decreasing true positive rates and true
        negative rates, e.g.:

    .. math::
        \mathbf{TPR} = ({TPR}_1, {TPR}_2, ..., {TPR}_m)

    11. Calculate ROC AUC.


Probability calibration
-----------------------

In order to accurately estimate the performance from the model scores, they need to be well calibrated. If a classifier assigns a probability of 0.9 for a set of observations and 90% of these observations belong to the positive class, we consider that classifier to be well calibrated with respect to that subset. Most predictive models focus on performance rather than on probability estimation, therefore their scores are rarely calibrated.
Examples of different models and their calibration curves are shown below [1]_:

Probabilities can be calibrated in post-processing. NannyML uses isotonic regression to
calibrate model scores [1]_ [2]_. Since some of the models
are probabilistic and their probabilities are calibrated by design, first NannyML checks whether calibration is required
. It is done according to the following logic:

1. Stratified shuffle split [3]_ (controlled for the positive class) of reference data into 3 folds.
2. For each fold, a calibrator is fitted on train and *predicts* new probabilities for test.
3. Quality of calibration is evaluated by comparing the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) [4]_ for the raw and calibrated
   (predicted) probabilities on the test splits:


    - If in any of the folds the ECE score is higher after post processing (i.e. calibration curve is worse), the
      calibration will not be performed.

    - If in each fold post processing improves the quality of calibration, the calibrator is fitted on the whole
      reference set and probabilities are calibrated on the set that is subject to analysis.

Calibrating probabilities is yet another reason why NannyML requires reference data that is not a training set of the monitored model.
Fitting a calibrator on model training data would introduce bias [1]_.
